# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using machine learning models trained on historical housing data.  
It demonstrates the full workflow: data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset (`dataset.csv`) contains housing features such as:

- **Lot Area** (size of the land)  
- **Overall Quality** (materials and finish of the house)  
- **Year Built**  
- **Number of Rooms**  
- **Sale Price** (target variable)  

*(Update with the exact column names from your dataset)*

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10+**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data handling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing & machine learning models  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlinaMuradyan/House-Price-Prediction.git
cd House-Price-Prediction
````

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # (Windows)
source venv/bin/activate  # (Linux/Mac)
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run the notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook Untitled.ipynb
```

This notebook loads the dataset, preprocesses it, trains regression models, and evaluates them.

## 📈 Results

* **Model Used:** (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost — update this)
* **R² Score:** `0.XX`
* **RMSE:** `XXXXX`

*(replace with your actual metrics from the notebook)*

## 🔮 Future Work

* Save trained model as `.pkl` using `joblib` or `pickle` for easy deployment.
* Build a web app (Flask/Streamlit) to serve predictions interactively.
* Try advanced models (LightGBM, CatBoost).
* Perform hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
